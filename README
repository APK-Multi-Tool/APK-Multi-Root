APK Multi-ROOT is a application that was written based off of the zerg exploit and built off of the 1 click exploit script as a base.

The Key Features of this application:
Rooting your Motorola Devices:
Tested using the Motorola Droid Bionic and the Samsung Sapphire
This application will also install Busybox superuser su and also Titianum Backup
also optional is that this application will also add 43V3R Root as well as the Bionic Boot strapper to allow you to boot into a custom recovery
This should work on most Motorola Devices as well as some other Android Phones

I currently have the system.img of the Bionic 5.5.886 but I have not built it into the script yet since I am hoping to pull or if someone can suppy me with the system.img of the Bionic 5.5.893
